Auxilliary modules to interface to gen1int, interest, lapack and to define a simple molecule type
written by Lucas Visscher, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, March 2022
Code edited by Mac Veldhuizen (student), to make it a more flexible code allowing for gaussian coordinates as inputMolecule with AU

On running: run by opening myapp
On compiling: use the make file

Main contains the intialisation of the process, as also the loop for itterations and the final output.

_________main.f90_________

Intialisation 
call define_molecule
    Takes the inputMolecule.txt as a input and reads the molecule out and sets it in the system. Uses register.f90 to allocate the atom type and its charge. 
    Sets it in ADT molecule in interfaces/molecular_structure.f90
call define_basis
    Takes the data from type(molecule), and sets the required amount of shells in the interfaces/oa_basis.f90

Process
    Uses a standard HF algorithm to solve the Hamiltonian
    1. Set up the core Hamiltonian - coreH(:,:) from overlap - S(:,:), kinetic - T(:,:), potential V(:,:) matrixes
    2. Use the diagonalization of the fock matrix - F(:,:) (call solve_genev in diagonalization.f90) to calculate the desity - D(:,:) matrix
    - Start loop/itterations
    3. Calculate the fock matrix - F(:,:) (call give_Fmatrix in itterations.f90)
    4. Diagonalization of the fock matrix (call solve_genev)
    5. Calculate new density matrix - D(:,:)
    6. Check convergence (F*D_old) - (D_old*F)
        If not converged go to 3

Final
    Calculates the energy for the HF using;
        core hamiltonian, density matrix, atomic oribital intergrals


________oa_basis.f90_________
Uses the read input to setup the basisfunctions. Contains the type(basis_set_info_t) and type(basis_func_info_t) in which the data for the basis sets is stored

Subroutine basis_routine_atom is called for each read atoms needs (charge, cur_coord, ao_basis) for which oa_basis is the total basis set. The function determines the required orbitals and uses it for determining the amount of shells

Subroutine add_shell_to_basis is called in for each basis set in basis_routine_atom


________diagonalization.f90_________
Contains the needed checks for using DSYEV which does the diagonalization


________ittertations.f90_________
Only contains a function for the making of a fock matrix


_________molecular_structure.f90_________
Contains the data for the whole molecule. Has type(molecular_structure_t)
         integer                  :: num_atoms=0  ! number of atoms
         real(REALD), allocatable :: charge(:)    ! nuclear charges
         real(REALD), allocatable :: coord(:,:)   ! coordinates of the atoms


_________register.f90_________
Contains a list with a type(atom_data). Used when reading the type of molecule to allocate charge and name. 
         character(2) :: name 
         real(8)      :: charge
