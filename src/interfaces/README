Auxilliary modules to interface to gen1int, interest, lapack and to define a simple molecule type
written by Lucas Visscher, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, March 2022
Code edited by Mac Veldhuizen (student), to make it a more flexible code allowing for gaussian coordinates as inputMolecule

Main contains the intialisation of the process, as also the loop for itterations and the final output.

Intialisation 
call define_molecule
    Takes the inputMolecule.txt as a input and reads the molecule out and sets it in the system
    Sets it in ADT molecule in interfaces/molecular_structure.f90
call define_basis
    Takes the data from type(molecule), and sets the required amount of shells in the interfaces/oa_basis.f90

Process
    Uses a standard HF algorithm to solve the Hamiltonian

Final
    Calculates the energy for the HF
